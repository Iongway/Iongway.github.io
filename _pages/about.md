I currently serve as the Tech Leader at Huawei [Pangu Lab](https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/pangu.html) since 2020. Specializing in Artificial General Intelligence, I am leading our team to seek the solution for infinite tasks, even the unseen ones, within a single AI model, abandoning the traditional approach of repeatedly developing numerous specialized models. I have authored or co-authored over 50 papers published in T-PAMI, NeurIPS, etc., and these papers have influenced the work of the Turing Award and Marr Prize winners. See the [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RDwnNsQAAAAJ) for more details.

Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en), [CASIA](https://www.ia.cas.cn/). Before I joined CAS, I graduated with a B.S. in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/) from [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). Throughout my journey, I am truly grateful to my life mentors, [Chunhong Pan](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~panchunhong), [Shiming Xiang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~xiangshiming), [Chenglin Liu](https://teacher.ucas.ac.cn/~liuchenglin), [Qi Tian](https://www.qitian1987.com/index.html), [Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/), [Liang Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~wangliang), [Gaofeng Meng](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~gfmeng), etc., for their efforts in imparting knowledge, teaching me valuable lessons, and resolving my doubts. In return, I am also willing to offer whatever help I can to others :)
