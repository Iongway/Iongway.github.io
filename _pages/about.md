I currently serve as the Tech Leader at Huawei Cloud in Beijing, motivated by [The Bitter Lesson](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~eunsol/courses/data/bitter_lesson.pdf) and [Platonic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07987). I have authored or co-authored over 50 papers published in leading journals and conferences, including T-PAMI and NeurIPS. See the [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RDwnNsQAAAAJ) for more details.

Our team specializing in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), is dedicated to driving innovation and empowering industries with AI solutions. **If this resonates with you, we are actively hiring ([full-time + internships](mailto:jianlong.chang@huawei.com))!**

Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en), [Institute of Automation](https://www.ia.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cas.cn/). My advisor was [Chunhong Pan](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~panchunhong) and I worked on relation-based deep
learning, deep graph networks, Auto ML. Before I joined CAS, I graduated with a B.S. in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/) from [the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/).
