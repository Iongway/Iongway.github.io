Since 2020, I have been assuming the position of Tech Leader at Huawei Pangu Lab. Specializing in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), I am leading our team to seek the solution for infinite tasks, even the unseen ones, within a single AI model, abandoning the traditional approach of repeatedly developing numerous specialized models. I have authored or co-authored over 50 papers published in leading journals and conferences, including T-PAMI and NeurIPS. See the [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RDwnNsQAAAAJ) for more details.

Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en), [Institute of Automation](https://www.ia.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cas.cn/). Before I joined CAS, I graduated with a B.S. in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/) from [the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). Throughout my journey of life, I am truly grateful to my life mentors, [Chunhong Pan](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~panchunhong), [Shiming Xiang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~xiangshiming), [Chenglin Liu](https://teacher.ucas.ac.cn/~liuchenglin), [Qi Tian](https://www.qitian1987.com/index.html), [Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/), [Liang Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~wangliang), [Gaofeng Meng](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~gfmeng), etc., for their efforts in imparting knowledge, teaching me valuable lessons, and resolving my doubts. In return, I am also willing to offer whatever help I can to others :)

If this resonates with you, we are actively hiring and sharing ([full-time + internships](mailto:jianlong.chang@huawei.com)).
